## BetterDummy

Forked from https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDummy. Check this out (and the associated README first!).

This fork is just to make some personal customisations to make BetterDummy work better for my personal setup. This is for dual 1440p monitors.

Specific changes are:

- Added a way of connecting and disconnecting all monitors automatically
- Removing a bunch of the resolutions I don't need to make the display menu less cluttered
